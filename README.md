# web-scraping-challenge
Homework 12

This homework was very difficult, and I definitely need more work with these concepts to feel comfortable own my own, but I learned a lot from being hands-on with this assignment. 

The feeling of accomplishment when the scrape button properly functioned is hard to describe and I'm really proud of the final product of the site.
